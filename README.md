## Problem Statement

Collected existing publicly available EDGAR weblogs, each line represented a single web request for an EDGAR document that would be streamed into the program in real time. Using the data, identified when a user visits, calculated the duration of and number of documents requested during that visit, and then wrote the output to a file.
